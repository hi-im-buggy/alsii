it

a

them

Nobody

The
laziness
of
IITB
profs
is
unparalleled
!
As
a
routine
backlogger
,
I
always
found
myself
taking
re-exams
in
summer
and
winter
.
Most
chootiya
profs
used
to
simply
repeat
the
last
endsem
paper
word
for
word
,
without
even
changing
the
date
or
the
test
values
in
each
question
.
That
ensured
I
passed
without
difficulty
and
got
good
grades
in
each
re-exam
.
Except
that
there
is
always
one
proverbial
shady
uncooperative
prof
,
who
is
not
only
immune
to
conning
,
but
actually
does
not
repeat
the
most
recent
end-sem
paper
*
grr
*
much
to
the
frustration
of
fellow
backloggers
like
me
.
I
was
unable
to
pass
even
after
2
re-exams
.
So
one
day
I
took
an
endsem
paper
,
changed
the
date
to
~
4
years
ago
and
managed
to
slip
into
his
office
(
he
leaves
it
open
while
sitting
in
the
lab
next
door
)
.
I
slipped
it
into
a
bunch
of
messy
papers
on
his
desk
and
bolted
from
there
.
2
sems
later
in
summer
was
the
re-exam
again
...
The
prof
was
amazed
how
from
constant
FF
I
cracked
a
BB
.
Now
we
know
eh
;)

#328
:
One
hot
night
during
summer
vacation
,
my
wingmates
and
I
were
sloshed
.
The
chootiyas
somehow
bet
me
to
walk
past
H-11
at
3am
wearing
only
a
bedsheet
like
a
monk's
robe
,
and
stark
naked
underneath
.
I
was
a
bigger
chootiya
to
accept
the
bet
.
I
was
sozzled
anyway
.
One
of
my
wingmates
waited
at
the
Staff
Hostel
on
his
bike
.
At
3am
,
I
walked
out
of
H-4
stark
naked
with
the
sheet
on
and
ran
like
the
wind
.
When
I
reached
the
bike
he
gave
me
the
finger
and
rode
off
,
leaving
me
nanga
in
a
bedsheet
,
to
walk
to
H4
past
either
H1
route
or
H5
route
.
Bastard
.

U
shud
feel
lucky
.
If
I
was
ur
friend
...
id
have
snatched
the
bedsheet
and
rode
away
.

I
am
a

met
this

Xavierite
big
city
boy
from
Bombay
.
He
thought
I
was
a
super
nerd
who
was
too
backward
.
Guess
he
just
wanted
action
.
So
during
our
initial
meetings
I
kept
being
a
cock-teaser
by
telling
him
about
the
guys
I
have
had
and
how
I
love
it
when
guys
talk
dirty
to
me
...
this
\
"
stud\
"
was
hooked
and
kept
sending
me
dirty
sms
throughout
the
day
,
he
constantly
tried
to
ask
me
out
and
sleep
with
me
.
Several
expensive
dinners
and
hot
groping
markout
sessions
and
a
year
later
,
he
gave
up
trying
.
I
got
to
hang
out
with
decent
crowd
,
not
the
loser
guys
at
IITB
,
got
free
meals
and
clubbing
for
a
year
though

If

I
am
graduating
this
year
.
Four
years
ago
,
as
a
reward
of
clearing
JEE
,
I
was
handed
a
letter
called
IIT
Bombay
which
contained
all
the
secrets
of
success
.
All
that
was
expected
of
me
was
to
open
the
letter
carefully
and
learn
the
content
.
.
.
I
shall
pass
it
to
one
of
my
juniors
.
Sealed
,
unopened
and
unread
.

#317
:
I
just
check
this
IITB
confession
page
to
feel
how
lucky
I
am
.
My
hubby
is
from
IITB
,
he
is
well
behaved
&
knows
the
value
of
people
and
relationships
.
He
never
made
me
feel
low
or
got
attracted
to
other
hot
chicks
.
I
feel
blessed
and
same
time
sorry
for
all
IITians
who
treating
relations
as
just
lust
and
measuring
everything
materialistically
in
terms
of
money
.

\
"
other
hot
chicks\
"
...
:-P

he
must
be
a
janitor

Rofl
.
The
ego
on
this
one

so
u
are
not
hot

thats
mainly
bcoz
he
is
sooooo
hen-pecked
by
U
!!!

#316
:
This
dates
back
to
few
years
ago
when
I
went
to
Europe
for
my
internship
.
To
save
money
for
accommodation
,
decided
to
travel
during
the
night
by
Eurolines
Bus
and
sleep
under
the
Eiffel
Tower
(
aka
Million
Stars
Hotel
)
:)
.
.
On
the
way
to
Paris
,
I
couldn't
sleep
because
of
excitement
.
there
was
this
German
guy
who
was
sitting
right
next
to
me
.
So
we
took
a
blanket
and
made
out
the
whole
night
:)
....

#315
:
While
I
was
still
in
IITB
,
I
was
seeing
this
girl
and
just
when
everything
was
going
right
,
she
met
this
older
dude
who
was
a
businessman
.
She
dumped
me
for
him
in
an
instant
,
and
it
kinda
broke
my
heart
.
After
a
few
months
I
found
out
that
she
left
me
for
him
only
because
of
money
.
So
I
hacked
into
his
account
,
sent
fake
emails
to
a
girl
who
was
a
common
friend
of
my
ex
,
showed
my
ex
those
fake
emails
,
this
startedhuge
trust
issues
and
fights
between
the
two
of
them
...
a
few
months
later
she
came
to
me
,
broke
down
and
apologized
,
we
had
great
make-up
sex
and
then
I
told
her
to
f**k
off
.

RESPECT
!

Great

Unlike
guys
who
can
only
get
it
off
one
way
,
we
girls
can
get
off
in
different
ways
...
we
just
need
a
bit
of
friction
and
rock
back
and
forth
.
Sadly
there
are
no
handshowers
in
the
hostels
here
(
D-uh
whoever
designed
the
girl's
toilet
block
)
but
it's
easy
to
rock
back
and
forth
in
the
liby
...
I
did
that
once
while
mugging
with
a
classmate
.
He
had
NO
idea
...

Gosh
!
So
that's
wot
it
is

With
all
those
old
ladies
in

I
recently
got
dumped
by
my
ex
because
she
says
I
am
boring
,
I
don't
dance
,
I
can't
act
,
I
can't
sing
and
I
don't
go
to
discs
and
pubs
.
Is
it
wrong
to
be
a
simple
guy
??

You
were
her
boyfriend
...
not
some
participant
in
a
talent
hunt
!
Move
on
buddy
....
she
is
not
worth
it
!

Actually
all
those
r
mere
excuses
...
No
one
dumps
anyone
unless
they've
already
found
someone
better
.
She's
just
trying
to
hide
the
fact
that
she
was
double-timing
on
U
..
Samjhaa
bitwaa
?
Doosri
pakad

exactly
...
she
need
a
person
who
can
be
gossiped
upon
and
flattered
about
while
being
an
eye-catcher
of
all
..
so
the
conclusion
is
the
above
two
persons
saying's
are
absolutely
right
.
Gear
up
back
yourself
and
you
will
be
able
to
feel
yourself
stronger
than
before
...
while
moving
on
..
IT
MIGHT
BE
TUFF
BUT
NOT
IMPOSSIBLE
buddt
.
all
the
best
,
tc

dude
..
just
move
on
!!!
she
never

you
..!!!
chill
..
next
time
please
be

someone
who
likes

3
of
us
get
kicks
when
we
run
bare-chested
in
camo
pants
while
listening
to
a
particular
soundtrack
we
like
on
loop
.
We've
been
caught
by
guards
twice
&
had
tough
time
explaining
why
we
were
half
naked
sunning
around
screaming
Hannah
&
Selena
...
It
may
seem
idiotic

we
get
an
amazing

it

of

time

again

So
one

to
reply

each
on
of
his
sleep-shouts
in
a
pseudo-feminine
voice

aroused
him
so
much
more
that
the

grabbed
his

a
few
times
and
then
pulled
his
wang
right
out

started
beating

I

he

to
discharge
some

And
tear-ducts
seem

be

IMHO
That's
what
it
boils
down
to
!

I
made
a
big
mistake
signing
up
for
an
internship
.
This
is
what
happens
when
you
join
a
giveup
internship
just
for
money
....
They
fuck
you
each
and
every
day
and
when
your
stamina
is
over
they
ask
you
why
you
don't
have
the
capability
to
get
fucked
further
since
you
are
an
IITian
.
And
then
they
fire
you
with
placement
penalty
points
and
fine
(
I
didn't
even
know
such
things
happen
)
.
.
So
just
a
piece
of
advice
-
don't
sign
any
damn
internship
offer
if
you
know
you
don't
like
it
,
then
a
sidey
project
is
the
best
thing
to
do
.
If
anyone
knows
how/where
to
check
placement
penalty
points
,
please
comment

One
of
my
wingmates
was
a
maha
nbdu
and
constantly
mugging
night
and
day
.
He
even
preferred
mugging
instead
of
fapping
to
porn
.
The
wing
decided
to
act
decisively
to
end
this
incorrigible
menace
.
One
day
during
midsems
this
inhuman
muggu
started
complaining
of
a
headache
as
he
had
been
mugging
for
14
hours
straight
,
and
was
upset
that
he
can't
keep
mugging
.
This
was
the
opportune
moment
we
had
been
waiting
for
.
I
quickly
substituted
isabgol
(
laxative
)
into
a
Multi
Vitamin
formula
capsule
bottle
and
told
him
this
will
keep
him
alert
throughout
the
night
,
and
he
should
take
2
tablets
every
hour
.
The
chootiya
kept
taking
isabgol
throughout
the
night
and
next
morning
he
had
to
bunk
the
midsems
because
he
was
stuck
in
the
bog
jetting
it
all
out

In
the
winter
of
'
99
I
came
up
with
a
brilliant
plan
.
My
wingman
and
I
would
walk
up
to
any
2
random
chicks
late
nights
and
tell
them
we
are
from
the
campus
security
cell
,
anti-leopard
squad
...
And
as
it
was
our
duty
to
ensure
the
safety
of
all
outsiders
,
we
got
to
latch
on
to
and
hang
out
with
new
chicks
almost
every
day
of
MI
that
winter
,
and
we
got
new
numbers
every
day
of
MI
.
In
2000
we
expanded
our
leopard
protection
service
and
we
started
targeting
IDC
babes
(
at
that
time
those
were
the
only
decent
quality
women
around
,
and
in
any
case
H10
knew
us
very
well
)
.
And
why
did
they
fall
for
this
?
We
had
printed
fake
ID
cards
with
IITB-LPS
on
them

This
is
an
Inter-IIT
love
story
.
I
was
a
simple
guy
and
never
ever
thought
I
will
fall
in
love
or
get
addicted
to
a
girl
.
As
it
happens
,
a
girl
came
in
my
life
and
she
changed
me
completely
.
I
was
totally
infatuated
with
her
and
watched
as
everything
around
me
including
my
personality
changed
just
for
her
.
I
was
obsessing
about
her
nonstop
...
wanted
to
be
there
with
her
,
for
her
...
everywhere
,
everytime
.
I
wanted
to
be
her
first
,
last
and
only
point
of
contact
.
In
time
she
got
into
another
IIT
.
But
then
she
started
meeting
other
people
and
avoiding
me
,
and
it
made
me
feel
very
disturbed
.
Then
she
dropped
the
ultimate
cock-blocking
man-bomb
and
said
that
she
doesn't
want
this
relationship
and
I
agreed
to
friendzoned
(
yes
i
cock-blocked
myself
)
.
Man
this
killed
me
and
affected
everything
around
me
,
felt
like
the
world
had
caved
in
suddenly
.
Obviously
it
affected
my
endsems
also
.
I
am
able
to
accept
if
she
gets
a
boyfriend
but
I
can't
imagine
them
having
sex
,
it
totally
kills
me
.
I
really
need
to
talk
to
her
and
be
around
her
.
I
have
learned
the
hard
way
to
live
without
her
but
being
with
her
adds
great
happiness
to
my
life
...
come
back
if
you
don't
have
a
boyfriend
.

this
is
funny
''
come
back
if
you
dont
have
a
bf
''
.
dude
you
need
to
give
it
a
thought
that
why
u
cant
imagine
them
having
sex
.

Yeah
bro
.
Dont
lose
hope
.
Believe
that
you
can
fall
in
love
again
and
with
a
different
persin
.
Once
you
find
love
again
,
you
will
forget
this
girl

chutiya
..
let
her
be
happy
..

So
4
of
us
general
loosers
were
waiting
near
H11
for
the
tumtum
and
we
got
a
clear
view
of
2
big
loose
mangoes
hanging
without
any
support
.
One
of
us
still
got
very
excited
and
this
was
visible
from
a
distance
(
duh
do
we
need
to
explain
how
)
.
So
our
excited
dude
somehow
concealed
his
pointy
arrow
and
followed
the
mangoes
till
infi
corridor
...
we
even
found
out
the
genus
,
species
and
name
of
the
tree
they
were
hanging
from
...
but
we
couldn't
get
a
taste
...

That
sounds
like
a
bad
batch
of
marijuana

:
H6
just
got
a
new
basky
court
completed
a
few
days
ago
.
Since
then
,
a
group
of
three
has
been
trying
to
score
baskets
all
day
in
and
day
out
,
all
in
vain
.
The
ball
hits
the
rim
or
the
hoop
or
the
board
and
bounces
back
at
them
as
if
it
were
a
boomerang
.
They
are
there
when
I
wake
up
at
8am
and
when
I
go
to
the
canteen
at
1pm
,
when
I
go
for
tiffin
at
5pm
and
when
I
go
for
dinner
at
9pm
.
But
the
basket
eludes
them
..
.
My
heart
goes
out
to
them
.

plus
,
i
don't
have
a
heart
!

nope
.
wake
up
at
8
?
of
all
things
,
dinner
??
at
9
??
daya

Sometimes
it's
better
to
bunk
a
class
and
enjoy
with
friends
,
today
when
I
look
back
,
marks
never
made
me
laugh
,
but
my
friends
and
memories
always
do
!

Marks
make
me
laugh
..
I
look
at
my
marks
and
I
laugh

I
am
really
thankful
to
guy
name
KISHORE
who
works
in
Academic
Office
.
I
think
most
of
you
must
be
aware
of
him
,
the
one
man
army
,
the
unsung
hero
who
must
have
helped
majority
of
junta
around
here
...
He
helped
me
several
times
with
registration
pain
.
Here
is
someone
who
won't
ignore
you
and
send
you
to
somebody
else's
door
.
He
knows
more
rules
and
regulations
then
my
FACAD
and
HoD
combined
regarding
registrations
...

What's
unbelievable
is
that
most
of
the
people
liking
this
re
not
even
from
IITB
...

he
is
helping
us
all
since
2nd
year
..!!

Anuj

come
on
people
,
find
this
guy
post
a
photo
here
...
we
need
to
recognize
several
of
our
unsung
heroes
!
Find
him
on
FB
and
even
tag
him
if
you
can
!

yes
,
he
is
helping
many
students
.
Anyways
,
isn't
he
suppose
to
know
more
rules
and
regulation
regarding
registration
than
FACAD
and
HOD
combined
?

He
is
helping
me
out
since
2nd
sem
:D

how
can
i
forget

I
met
my
bf
while
in
engg
college
and
we
dated
for
almost
3
years
.
Now
I'm
a
matki
in
IITB
and
he
is
doing
his
masters
in
some
other
college
as
he
wasn't
able
to
crack
GATE
.
We
don't
meet
as
often
and
after
coming
to
IITB
I
feel
even
a
2nd
yearite
undergrad
has
superior
intellect
and
I'm
losing
respect
for
him
...
Truth
be
told
I'm
actually
attracted
to
a
cool
Matka
dude
in
my
class
and
I
really
need
to
find
a
way
to
break
up
with
my
bf
.
Any
suggestions
?

Ya

just
do
it
..
And
I
hope
this
guy
do
the
same
with
you
after
3
years
when
he
will
find
some
one
smarter
than
you
in
his

I
studied
at
PACE
and
we
were
taught
by
this
vernacular
genius
who
said
that
he
taught
Priyank
and
that
he
was
his
favorite
.
Then
he
started
talking
about
how
Priyanks
are
used
to
remove
caffeine
from
coffee
beans
.
And
everybody
is
being
really
dumb
and
thinking
that
suddenly
they've
all
lost
their
hearing
senses
.
After
some
time
he
draws
those
Priyank's
structure
on
the
board
.
It
turns
out
he
was
talking
about
freons
...

Priyank

Once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
crooked
GS
who
did
not
notify
students
about
an
exchange
program
so
that
he
could
send
3
of
his
friends
for
the
same
.

4
years
ago
a
Xavier's
girl
met
an
IITian
and
they
started
going
out
.
They
then
broke
up
because
of
stupid
problems
.
The
probability
of
you
reading
this
is
virtually
nil
but
I
do
wish
we
had
never
broken
up
.
I
know
yoU'RE
still
single
but
I
haven't
been
able
to
tell
you
my
real
feelings
.
If
somehow
you
magically
see
this
and
msg
me
I
know
the
universe
is
giving
me
a
sign
that
we
should
be
together
again
.

And
then

True

So
dont
loose
it
due
to
any
stupid
ego
or

feelings
or
misunderstandings

If
u
r
so
sure
she

go
urself

search
her
anyhow
,
clear
the
differences
&
get
her
back

I
wish
u
a
ultimate

#285
:
Its
been
nearly
4
years
out
of
IITB
.
Everytime
I
run
through
content
on
coursera
,
OCW
and
other
open
educational
platforms
,
I
feel
regret
.
Why
?
I
never
really
learned
anything
at
IIT
.
Reason
:
Me
,
Profs
,
Environment
,
Culture
.....
.
Education
at
IIT
was
a
breeze
for
me
.
I
studied
on
the
last
day
and
was
placed
in
the
top
20%
easily
.
I
knew
I
would
never
do
\
"
Core\
"
.
(
Jobs
were
cool
man
)
.
IITB
was
a
stamp
and
that's
it
.
When
you
see
the
lecturers
at
the
top
US
univs-
you
quake
with
intellectual
fervor
.
In
IIT-
you
despise
them
.
The
end
result
:
I
got
my
job
,
am
a
manager
at
an
MNC
-
but
I
have
never
had
a
real
college
education
....
.
\
"
The
purpose
of
a
real
education
is
to
change
you\
"
.
Now-
the
last
4
years
HAVE
changed
me
-
I've
read
up
on
western
and
eastern
philosophy
;
met
and
lived
with
people
who
were
humble
and
brilliant
;
traveled
,
failed
and
succeeded
alone
.
What
is
the
take
away
?.
.
a
.
I
hope
some
of
you
may
have
the
courage
to
say
NO
to
a
safe
stream
and
take
something
you
like
(
or
just
say
no
to
IIT
)
(
I'm
not
perfect-
I
got
into
the
wrong
stream
and
wasted
4
years
there
)
..
.
b
.
IMHO
:)
-
students
at
IIT
need
to
be
a
bit
more
humble
.
The
hubris
and
over-confidence
of
a
large
section
there
is
built
on
an
edifice
of
ignorance
.
If
you're
as
perplexed
as
I
was
about
this
cockiness
-
atleast
now
you
know
you're
not
alone
..
.
c
.
The
faculty
...
I
was
scolded
for
asking
more
questions
after
class
by
a
prof
...
The
IITs
take
in
the
hardest
working
junta
in
india
...
and
let
them
wallow
!
Huge
rejig
needed
,
get
in
nobel
prize
winning
guys
:)
.
.
d
.
Hold
more
career
workshops
;
more
humanities
courses
(
Life
is
more
about
humanities
than
engineering
,
you
will
realize
this
someday
)
.

_/\\_

:)
So
true

I
will
have
my
version
of
this
someday

Thank
you
for
telling
the
truth
as
it
is
.
Very
honorable
!

This
is
for
a
particular
shitty
prof
.
For
three
weeks
I've

which
the
protagonist
went
on

#282
:
Around
20
years
ago
,
I
was
perennially
broke
and
needed
extra
cash
for
more
sutta
and
daaru
.
So
in
a
state
of
drunken
stupor
,
I
placed
a
silly
bet
with
the
equally
drunk
morons
in
the
room
with
me
.
The
bet
required
that
I
had
to
stand
stark
naked
in
front
of
H9
main
mess
hall
for
minimum
1
minute
,
at
peak
lunchtime
.
Within
a
week
,
the
entire
hostel
was
aware
of
this
bet
and
each
person
contributed
Rs
10
to
the
pot
.
By
D-Day
the
prize
money
collected
was
in
excess
of
Rs
1000
(
that's
easily
worth
Rs
7
~
8k
today
)
which
was
collected
by
junta
for
the
grand
event
.
At
the
appointed
hour
when
the
mess
was
full
,
I
lost
my
nerve
and
refused
to
go
down
nanga
.
But
it
was
a
matter
of
honor
for
the
wing
,
so
4
strongarm
wingmates
grabbed
me
and
marched
me
down
naked
while
I
covered
my
privates
...
when
the
stopwatch
started
,
they
held
my
hands
up
for
a
full
1
minute
while
all
mess-goers
of
H9
got
a
glimpse
of
my
sceptre
,
family
jewels
and
unkempt
fields
.
That
Rs
1000
didn't
even
last
2
days
because
my
chootiya
wingmates
drank
everything
.

seems
a
fairytale
but
anything
is
possible
at
iitb
....

This
was
the
best
confession
!

#281
:
There
is
a
fat
chick
from
the
insti
who
uses
my
roomie

And
a
thousand
other
guys
in

insti
.
I
feel
bad
for
you
dogs
,
come
on
,
open
your
eyes
,
you
can
do
much
better
than
a
random
slut
who
takes
advantage

your
tharkiness

you're

its
okay

bait

lure

use
guys
then
?

Guys
don't
use
sexuality
to
lure
women
and
get
things
done
and
get
their
bills
paid
...

Why
is
it
that
when
a
boy
tries
to
have
\
"
fun\
"
,
he
is
called
a
\
"
player\
"
or
\
"
tharki\
"
but
if
a
girl
does
the
SAME
thing
,
she
is
called
a
\
"
slut\
"
?

If
one
lock
can
be
opened
by
many
keys
,
it's
called
a
shitty
lock
...
but
if
one
key
opens
many
locks
it's
called
a
MASTER
KEY
haha
!!
:P

@nahid
isnt
your
reply
an
answer

Such
men
deserve
the
kind
of
women
they
get
!

Back
in
the
'
90s
in
my
2nd
yr
1st
sem
,
we
put
a
spoof
ad
in
Mid-Day
posing
as
a
modeling
agency
and
provided
a
mobile
number
and
email
address
.
Got
300+
emails
,
phone
numbers
,
sizzling
portfolio
photos
etc
from
wannabe
models
and
hotties
all
over
Bombay
.
And
everyone
always
wondered
how
I
was
never
single
...

To
all
those
calling
this
fake
,
this
was
a
true
story
which
happened
in
1998-99
.
Yes
we
had
cellphones
,
and
yes
email
was
popular
.
There
was
no
high
speed
internet
except
for
a
few
labs
.
You
guys
are
sounding
like
a
bunch
of
unimaginative
slackers
and
lazy
wannabes
.
Our
reality
was
so
far
from
yours
that
we
can't
imagine
how
you
guys
live
on
campus
any
more
.
In
fact
I
truly
believe
that
all
you
kids
do
these
days
is
watch
porn
,
stalk
chicks
on
FB
and
jerk
off
alone
.

the

I

Didn't

Then
luckily

could

I'm
a
campusite
girl
who
grew
up
in
IITB
,
10-12
years
back
,
IITB
guys
really
had
style
and
attitude
.
Sadly
I
was
in
6th
grade
I
used
to
see
them
while
going
to
school
;)
But
now
over
the
years
I
hardly
see
any
guy
who
is
good
...
or
even
look
halfway
decent
.
Way
back
then
I
tried
talking
to
some
,
they
used
to
say
hello
baby
kis
school
mein
ho
,
chocolate
pasand
hai
:(
:(

Hey

12
years

I
was

was

maybe

Can
someone

why
do
Bongs

Tams
,

Kannada
junta
stay
together
in
their
tight-knit
group
rarely
socialising
with
anyone
outside
who
don't
share
the
same
state
?
I
see
Biharis
,
Bhaiyas
,
Rajasthanis
,
Gujjus
,
Punjabis
etc
mixing
and
becoming
friends
easily
with
each
other
but
rarely
a

I

"
Exceptions
exist

they
are

am

I
am
one
of
the

from

in

very
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
it
here
:)
we
had
a
good
time
,
2
of
us
got
superdrunk
and
we
had
a
good
time
at
IIT
.
I
remember
there
was
this
bunch
of
stoners
making
joints
and
lying
flat
on
the
dance
floor
.
The

anyone
has

I'm
from
IITB
and
in
the
closet
because
nobody
in
India
can
really
understand
what
we
go
through
in
society
if
we
come
out
.
The
plus
point
is
there
are
so
many
guys
to
fantasize
about
,
I
really
like
the
unkempt
unshaven
look
but
I
wish
some
of
the
guys
would
take
a
bath
and
keep
themselves
clean
.
I
casually
put
my
arm
around
my
friends
and
they
don't
even
suspect
a
thing
.

Yikes
sexual
harassment
right
there
.

#273
:
I
am
a
sophie
from
Delhi
.
My
dad
gives
me
enough
pocket-money
so
I
waste
it
all
around
and
discover
whatever
possibly
I
can
with
that
.
I
recently
tried
a
good
quality
escort
service
twice
and
had
a
good
time
.
It's
so
much
better
than
wasting
time
taking
girls
out
for
expensive
dinners
and
then
going
for
romantic
walks
and
then
waiting
for
the
right
moment
to
make
a
move
which
you
don't
know
will
be
reciprocated
or
not
.
And
even
then
it's
frustrating
when
they
cockblock
you
from
getting
past
1st
or
2nd
base
.
In
the
end
you
waste
many
days
of
your
time
and
many
thousands
if
Rs
of
your
dad's
hard-earned
money
chasing
pussy
and
never
getting
any
...
So
take
my
advice
,
visit
a
good
escort
and
have
a
good
time
,
you
know
what
you're
getting
and
you
don't
have
to
waste
time
and
money
in
expensive
dinners
or
flowers
...
The
action
(
really
good
quality
action
)
is
guaranteed
.
The
moral
of
the
story
is
this
:
THE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
SEX
FOR
MONEY
AND
SEX
FOR
FREE
IS
THAT
SEX
FOR
MONEY
IS
ALWAYS
CHEAPER
.

do

~

Well
the
reason
we
have
so
much
stuff
worth
confessing
about
is
because
we
actually
went
out
and
did
stuff
instead
of
sitting
on
Facebook
(
we
didn't
even
have
the
Internet
)
.
Go
ahead
,
try
arranging
a
social
,
you
will
automatically
interact
with
real
girls
,
instead
of
the
pornstars
you're

I
believe
an

an
inconclusive

The

you

:
One
of
he
tricks
I
have
used
several
times
successfully
in
order
to
get
an
II
instead
of
FR
or
XX
especially
when
bunking
an
endsem
,
is
to
buy
ayurvedic
Jivodaya
Netraprabha
eyedrops
,
bunk
the
endsem
,
halfway
thru
go
to
prof's
office
(
when
you
know
the
lab
sidey
or
the
TA
is
invigilating
)
put
1
drop
of
Netraprabha
in
each
eye
and
enter
the
office
(
you
need
to
do
this
real
quick
)
.
By
this
time
your
eyes
will
be
super
red
watering
and
dark
black
tears
will
be
running
down
your
face
,
this
is
when
you
lean
on
his
desk
and
pathetically
tell
the
prof
you
have
acute
contagious
viral
conjunctivitis
and
you
are
very
sorry
that
you
couldn't
attend
the
endsem
.
By
this
time
your
eyes
will
be
blood
red
burning
and
tears
will
be
streaming
onto
the
prof's
desk
,
he
will
jump
back
in
fear
of
contamination
and
scream
at
you
to
get
the
fuck
out
of
his
office
.
Of
course
you
need
to
do
all
this
in
less
than
30
seconds
,
because
that's
when
the
eye
drops
have
finished
their
initial
burning
effect
and
your
eyes
now
feel
cool
and
heavenly
peaceful
(
careful
the
fucking
drops
are
addictive
)
and
the
redness
goes
away
.
I
have
conned
profs
4
times
with
this
tactic
,
successfully
getting
II
instead
of
XX
and
getting
an
entire
summer/winter
to
mug
at
leisure
.

Awesome
even
if
fake
sounding

II
does
not
warrant
you
a
re-exam
.
DUGC
takes
(
up
)
your
case
and
then
decides
whether
or
not
you
deserve
one
.

I
did
this
twice
,
by
getting
a
'
pink
'
slip
after
convincing
the
doc
that
I
'
fainted

back
in
the
'
90s
H9
used
to
organize
\
"
socials\
"
with
Sophia
college
.
Essentially
we
would
arrange
mega
booze
,
weed
etc
,
hire
a
bus
and
send
it
to
Sophia
,
they
would
fill
it
with
all
sorts
of
girls
,
bus
comes
back
to
H9
,
party
happens
in
the
party
hall
on
top
on
the
mess
hall
...
Everyone
would
be
drunk
and
wasted
,
and
boys
&
girls
all
had
fun
;)
Then
in
1997
some
moron
OD'd
and
created
a
public
nuisance
,
and
all
socials
got
banned
.
No
more
Sophia
socials
after
that
:(
.
.
.
.
Here
is
a
photo
of
the
last
social
held
at
H9
terrace
on
4
Feb
1997
.
I
am
one
of
the
people
in
it
!

Eddie
,
You
are
a
guy(provable
!
)
.
My
observations
on
your
commenting
style
and
a
comparative
observation
on
the
guys
in
that
photo
,
you
must
be
the
guy
raising
his
left
hand
or
the
guy
in
the
yellow
shirt
.
That
s
all
your
honor
!!!

I
Wonder
who
it
is

I
never
studied
in
the
IIT
system
.
When
I
was
selected
as
faculty
at
IITB
I
was
really
tense
to
teach
what
I
thought
were
super
brilliant
IITians
.
After
a
few
months
months
of
joining
I
realized
that
many
of
my
senior
profs/colleagues
are
useless
old
farts
who
have
worse
teaching
skill
than
me
.
This
feeling
boosted
my
confidence
and
now
I'm
having
a
great
time
here
doing
quite
good
;)

#255
:
I
lived
in
IITB
for
23
years
of
my
life
,
my
school
was
in
IITB
,
I
learned
swimming
there
,
learned
how
beautiful
things
could
get
,
saw
how
the
world
famous
college
is
from
the
inside
,
living
there
as
a
family
member
by
not
giving
JEE
at
all
,
all
my
first
things
started
here
,
my
1st
love
,
1st
jump
in
the
swimming
pool
,
1st
time
saw
leopard
in
IITB
when
small
,
1st
dance
show
,
1st
cycle
one
IITB
student
gifted
me
I
used
to
bug
him
all
the
time
to
teach
me
.
I
attended
Mood
Indigo
since
I
was
in
4th
grade
till
I
turned
23
without
fail
...
It
was
like
a
ritual
to
attend
whether
friends
with
you
or
not
,
and
being
a
family
member
entry
was
very
easy
if
not
one
phone
call
used
to
solve
the
problem
.
After
moving
out
of
this
place
I
realized
I
was
living
in
heaven
,
the
outside
world
is
so
sick
,
so
crowded
,
so
many
people
around
,
horns
,
yelling
at
each
other
etc
...
inside
IITB
inside
the
only
noise
was
of
the
calm
campus
and
the
breezy
trees
...
I
Love
IITB
like
anything
and
I
miss
it
to
the
core
...
MUAAhh
to
IITB

you're

stop

you

not

treat

it

#249
:
I
just
dunno
how
to
talk
to
girls
.
But
then
I
think
what
the
fuck
do
I
want
to
talk
to
a
girl
when
all
I
want
is
to
have
a
little
fun
,
to
have
romance
.
Many
kanjoos
people
who
dont
wanna
spend
money
have
gf's
and
they
TALK
to
them
and
walk
along
the
lake
etc
...
I
may
not
have
much
to
talk
about
but
I'm
a
big
spender
.
I'm
.
feeling
totally
depressed
when
I
see
cheapo
couples
in
IITB
.

So
if
you
think
relationships
are
just
about
spending
money
.,.,..
i
am
glad
you
don't
have
any
Girlfriend

I
am
a

This
happened
13
years
ago
.
I
used
to
play
tennis
a
lot
on
the
old
tennis
courts
as
a
kid
.
One
IIT
dude
used
to
park
his
brand
new
bike
and
play
tennis
.
I
always
used
to
bug
this
guy
to
let
me
have
a
test-ride
of
his
bike
.
One
fine
day
he
did
,
and
I
totally
crashed
it
nearby
.
He
must
have
been
a
total
idiot
,
because
I
was
only
like
11
years
old
at
the
time
...

score
is
1
-
1
.
now
.
BTW
the
kid
never
forgot
the
riding
lessons
.
He
still
proudly
claims
to
have
learnt
riding
on
a
new
CBZ

You
should
try
whatever
may

consequence

Go
tell
her
that
you
love
her

it's
the
best
chance

to
propose

otherwise
u
would
be
another

We
need
to
know
who
this

I

A
girl
who
worked
on
campus
asked
me
out
but
I
wasn't
confident
about
my
future
so
I
declined
and
stopped
talking
to
her
.
It
was
a
hard
and
painful
decision
for
me
but
I
was
pretending
to
be
very
casual
about
it
.
Yesterday
we
had
a
small
chat
and
she
told
me
that
she
is
not
working
here
anymore
!
I
am
feeling
really
really
very
bad
,
we
had
not
been
talking
for
more
than
15
days
and
I
was
the
only
reason
for
it
but
still
there
was
a
feeling
that
somehow
we
are
close
to
each
other
.
Now
we
are
no
longer
on
the
same
campus
anymore
,
and
I
have
never
shown
her
my
true
feelings

There
was
a
very
nbdu
PhD
dude
in
my
lab
and
he
was
really
bad
in
English
.
He
asked
me
to
proofread
a
paper
he
wrote
,
I
spent
2
weeks
sitting
on
it
doing
nothing
,
at
the
last
minute
I
told
him
it
needs
a
full
rewrite
as
the
language
is
very
bad
and
made
up
a
fart
story
saying
how
hard
I
have
been
working
on
his
paper
since
2
weeks
etc
etc
...
In
the
end
I
rewrote
it
in
2
hours
and
handed
it
over
,
his
prof
was
so
impressed
he
asked
how
and
the
nbdu
told
him
he
took
my
help
,
the
prof
insisted
that
my
name
be
written
as
a
co-author
.
And
that's
how
a
4-pointer
gets
a
paper
published
with
a
highly
reputed
prof
in
an
international
journal
;)

I
was
in
the
same
class
,
same
lab
as
this
dude
...
I
have
a
copy
of
this
paper
.
This
sort
of
thing
was
de
rigeur
while
we
were
on
campus

I
gather
none
of
this
happens
anymore

First
I
was
suspicious
,
now
I'm
90%
sure
who
this
M2K
guy
is
,
if
he
is
the
same
as
the
one
who
learned
Greek
for
kicks
,
he
is
a
psycho
.
By
3rd
year
he
was
taking
notes
in
Arabic
and
Cyrillic
as
well
.

If
you
have
a
clue
know
who
this
guy
is
,
tell
us
,
we
have
been
trying
to
find
out
too

During

final
year
in
EP
,
all
the
nbdu
nerds
in
our
dept
started
chilling
out
.
For
my
birthday
we
were
supposed
to
have
a
small
treat
so
I
gave
the
money
to
this
dept
topper
and
told
him
I
will
meet
you
guys
later
.
So
as
it
turned
out
that
these
guys
went
and
had
the
treat
without
me
and
then
simply
put
the
blame
on
poor
EP
nbdu
topper
,
when
all
he
was
famous
for
was
laughing
all
the
time
(
apart
from
the
fact
that
he
was
the
most
intelligent
guy
of
our
batch
)

I
was
an
exchange
student
at
IITB
...
it
was
an
amazing
experience
.
India
has
so
much
to
give
...
many
things
to
see
.
And
everyday
there
is
something
new
to
discover
.
But
,
I
was
really
surprised
to
see
that
boys
and
girls
either
mix
nor
understand
each
other
.
I
don't
think
girls
are
just
entertainment
or
distraction
.
We
can
be
more
friends
with
them
than
with
other
guys
,
they
are
like
us
.
.
Stop
objectifying
and
criticizing
them
.
There
are
only
few
girls
in
IIT
.
You
should
take
care
of
them
and
learn
to
know
them
better
.
Love

In
my
3rd
sem
during
PH209
I
bunked
several
classes
and
when
I
opened
the
textbook
to
mug
I
realized
there
are
a
few
greek
letters
that
I
don't
know
...
hence
I
decided
to
mug
the
entire
greek
alphabet
.
So
I
learned
all
the
28
letters
and
how
to
write
+
pronounce
them
.
Then
I
got
really
ambitious
,
I
started
writing
down
class
notes
substituting
greek
letters
instead
of
the
equivalent
english
letters
,
in
all
classes
.
By
the
end
of
the
semester
,
I
was
able
to
write
in
english-in-greek
fluently
,
as
fast
as
the
prof
would
blabber
.
By
the
time
endsems
came
,
I
opened
my
notes
to
mug
,
and
realized
that
while
I
could
transliterate
very
fast
,
I
didn't
develop
the
reverse
skill
,
to
read
greek-into-english
.
So
a
day
before
the
endsems
,
there
I
was
,
all
my
notes
were
in
greek
and
I
couldn't
read
them
.
I
flunked
4
out
of
6
subjects
that
semester
.

_/\\_
I
actually
know
this
guy
and
it's
a
true
story
,
in
fact
this
guy
is
M2K
but
for
some
reason
he
chose
not
to
sign
his
name
to
the
post

You're
right
I
confused
Arabic
with
Greek
,
that's
the
language
I
learned
immediately
after
Greek
,
and
all
this
happened
15+
years
ago

My

to
not
fall
into

,
when
you

up

then
you'll
realize
the
returns
you
got
don't

In
my
3rd
yr
I
was
working
in
one
of
the
dept
labs
one
afternoon
after
a
very
bad
lunch
and
I
had
a
huge
urge
to
take
a
dump
.
Went
to
the
department
bathroom
,
the
bog
next
to
me
was
occupied
,
and
I
knew
my
tummy
was
going
to
get
noisy
,
so
I
held
it
in
for
a
good
20
minutes
.
It
seemed
like
the
other
guy
was
doing
the
same
,
because
neither
of
us
moved
from
the
toilet
,
nor
did
we
plop
plop
anything
into
the
pot
.
I
was
about
to
burst
when
the
guy
just
said
:
\
"
Fuck
benchod
,
I
have
to
go\
"
It
sounded
like
he
had
some
mean
diarrhea
.
Just
a
few
minutes
before
that
I
recognized
the
guy
by
his
shoes
,
it
was
my
TA
.
I
don't
think
I
will
be
able
to
look
at
him
without
remembering
our
little
encounter
in
the
bathroom
.

throughout
my
4
years
at
IITB
I've
done
something
I'm
very
proud
of
.
I
used
to
turn
off
the
lights
in
the
bogs
when
I
saw
people
in
the
cubicles
.
I'd
always
say
something
like
'
LIGHTS
OUT
'
or
'
GAME
OVER
'
before
I
would
hit
the
switch
.
Sorry
to
all
who
were
unfortunate
enough
to
be
in
those
cubicles

I
just
started
MS
after
leaving
an
unknown
college
in
India
,
and
everytime
I
visit
the
liby
in
my
uni
I
see
this
desi
guy
,
and
he
starts
talking
to
me
.
How
nice
I
thought
,
at
first
.
Not
long
after
talked
to
him
,
he
managed
to
find
me
on
FB
...
we
have
no
mutual
friends
,
and
everytime
I'm
online
he
always
tries
to
chat
with
me
...
and
everytime
I
visit
the
uni
liby
he
always
tries
to
sit
beside
me
.
He's
just
creeping
me
out
...
[
turns
out
he
is
also
pursuing
MS
and
was
from
IITB
]

Maybe
just

He
lives

Now
,
after

I
have
a
big

I've
done
more
than
a

very
questionable
things

I
am
proud

I
learned
some
tricks
along

way

is
fucked
up

an

Why
do
IITB
guys
always
wear
weird
clothes
and
chappals
???

because
it
reduces
the
probability
of
getting
a
girl
.
which
in
turn
reduces
the
probability
of
our
precious
money
being
wasted
on
these

I
want
to
confess
that
I
am
a
total
loser
.
I
saw
the
most
beautiful
girl
during
Techfest
and
followed
her
to
the
bus
stop
as
she
was
leaving
campus
.
As
much
as
I
wanted
to
talk
to
her
and
get
to
know
her
,
I
did
not
.
She
got
in
Bus
422
and
left
.
The
same
thing
happened
the
next
day
and
I
followed
her
again
to
the
bus
stop
.
This
would
have
been
the
perfect
chance
for
me
to
talk
to
her
but
I
was
so
busy
eating
my
bar-one
and
being
a
loser
that
I
didn't
.
After
a
while
,
422
arrived
and
I
did
not
even
get
on
the
bus
.
I
am
such
a
loser
...

#
Just
want
to
get
this
off
my
chest
.
I
haven't
expressed
my
feelings
to
anyone
.
.
.
I
was
coordinator
of
MI
2012
.
Right
from
the
beginning
i
worked
with
true
enthusiasm
,
dedication
and
passion
.
During
MI
OC
elections
,
I
was
considered
a
very
strong
candidate
for
CG
as
people
appreciated
my
work
a
lot
.
Somehow
I
wasn't
selected
as
a
CG
member
.
I
literally
cried
thebwhole
night
when
results
were
declared
..
I
just
want
to
ask
one
question
,
is
this
what
one
gets
for
true
hard
work
and
dedication
?
I
don't
have
any
regrets
regarding
working
hard
for
MI
.
The
memories
I
have
gathered
will
be
cherished
for
life
.
I
know
some
people
in
thebcurrent
team
who
don't
give
a
fuck
about
about
MI
.
Now
they
have
become
CG
members
and
it's
their
job
to
make
MI
happen
.
If
a
person
is
sentimental
about
something
definitely
he'll
be
contributing
a
lot
more
towards
the
goodwill
of
MI
.
Quality
of
MI
is
degrading
just
because
of
these
people
who
work
just
for
the
sake
of
PR
..
Anyways
i'll
always
be
there
whenever
MI
team
needs
me
.
Best
of
luck
to
new
team
MOOD
INDIGO
2013
.
Take
MI
to
a
higher
level
this
time
.

Yeah
...
life
is
tough
in
mi
politics
.
Consider
it
a
prep
for
corporAte
work
life

I
can
also
relate
to
this
as
I
too
was
always
a
curious
being
.
I
am
sure
you
are
not
alone
with
this
feeling
.
Hypothetically
in
every
college
,
similar
things
happen
every
year
.
And
everyone
of
us
would
like
to
say
Best
of
Luck
to
the
new
team
.
About
your
experience
as
organiser
,
I
am
sure
it
will
always
be
a
memory
to
cherish
:)
And
I
am
very
sure
,
being
a
CG
is
not
the
only
thing
you
can
dream
of
,
in
life
?
Dream
Bigger
.
Amen

I
got
a
DD
in
HS101
becuase
of
a
khadoos
prof
so
I
swore
to
take
revenge
someday
.
And
so
the
next
year
when
I
was
a
sophie
,
I
attended
the
HS101
endsem
,
found
out
the
last
roll
number
in
Meta
,
added
1
more
to
it
,
created
a
fake
name
and
proceeded
to
write
the
endsem
full
of
hardcore
literary
porn
.
Instead
of
graphs
I
drew
several
hardcore
sketches
or
various
porn
activities
,
and
I
was
very
proud
of
my
newfound
talent
at
endsem-art
.
Unfortunately
the
prof
didn't
give
me
a
grade
this
time
,
(
if
he
did
then
presumably
XXX
would
be
justified
)
